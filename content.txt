1. Class and Object(example)
2. Classs has data/attributes and functions/methods
    > Code walkthrough
    > Attributes get called itself and methods are called manually.
3. Why python is called object oriented programming? --> Everything in the python is an object (Data structure, Data Type etc)
4. Advantages of OOPs.
    > You can create your own datatype.
    > Code reesuability
    > Debugging
    > Easy to colab
5. End to end project (chatbook class)
    > Function vs Method
    > Magic method / Dunder method
    > self
    > Encapsulation
    > Getter and Setter
    > Static Method

6. Inheritance
    > Inheritance code example
    > Why inheritance is needed? (code reesuability, parent has no access to child class)
    > WHat gets Inherited ? Constructor, Non private attributes, non private methods.
    > Constructor overloading and method overloading
    > super key word (can be use only inside class, cannot access variables/attributes, used only inside childclass)
    > Types of inheritance  
        1.Single or Basic Inheritance
        2.Multilevel Inheritance
        3.Hierarchical Inheritance
        4.Multiple Inheritance (Diamon Problem)
        5.Hybrid Inheritance
